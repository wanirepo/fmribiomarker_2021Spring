## Download
You can download the class materials using the following command line:

	$ git clone https://github.com/wanirepo/advancedfmrianalysis_2019fall

Once you clone the github repository, you can just type the following command to get the updated github repository:

	$ git pull
	
Or you can download the repository as a zip file or you can also use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). The class materials will be uploaded (e.g., lecture slides, assignments) before each class. 

There is a good github tutorial: [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html)

## What are the aims of this course?

The functional neuroimaging, esp. functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has revolutionalized how we study human brain functions, human cognition, and behaviors. It enables us to study fine-grained neural dynamics and representations that give rise to adaptive human behaviors and cognitions. The powerful imaging methods and neuroimaging data had called for better analysis methods and approaches, and thanks to recent advances in statistical and computational methods (including machine learning), more researchers are developing and applying more advanced analysis methods to neuroimaging data. However, using more advanced methods itself does not make the study better automatically, and sometimes advanced methods make research worse by sacrificing the interpretability, robustness, and reproducibility of the research findings. These advanced methods should be used very carefully with a critical mind to actually help make research better. 

**Important note (Jan 2021):** The idea of opening this class began with the conversation with some lab people. Many lab members wanted to have a course for the introductory materials to become a competent cocoan lab members. Thus this year (only 2021 spring), this class will be dedicated to the cocoan lab members. This year's class will be designed as a COCOAN 101 (i.e., intro to cocoan lab), and therefore might not be helpful for people outside of the lab. Thus I don't recommend taking the class if you don't have to take the class this semester. I will open the class (with the same class number) for general students next year. 

If you're not the cocoan lab member, but if you need to take the class this year for some reason, please contact me in advance through the email above. 

**Updates on the plan (25 Feb 2021):** I originally designed this class to create high-quality intro videos for fMRI analysis and fMRI-based biomarker development for future lab members and also future fMRI classes, and our lab members graciously agreed to put a collective effort to make the videos. For this reason, I originally planned this class open only to the lab members, but I realized that there are many people outside of the lab who still want to take the class with these constraints.

With a long thought, I decided to open this class to all people, and I will share the videos we're making throughout the semester with all the students. But given that there will be some videos that are not relevant to you, I will share some lectures that I already have instead of the videos for some week. Our lab members will do the most of the labors (of making videos), and you will just need to watch the video lectures.

For grading, there is nothing you need to do other than watching the videos that I'll be uploading every week and learning the basics of fMRI. I believe that for grad students, self-motivation for learning is the most important thing, and thus I want to give you the opportunity to act only by your intrinsic motivation, meaning that there won't be any requirements for this class this semester. But if you have questions, feel free to email me any time. :)
